CodingProblem3:
Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

CodingProblem8: 
Given an array of strictly the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', segregate the values of the array so that all the Rs come first, the Gs come second, and the Bs come last. You can only swap elements of the array.

CodingProblem9:
Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.

CodingProblem10:
Given an unordered list of flights taken by someone, each represented as (origin, destination) pairs, and a starting airport, compute the person's itinerary. If no such itinerary exists, return null. If there are multiple possible itineraries, return the lexicographically smallest one. All flights must be used in the itinerary.

CodingProblem11:
Given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word, write a function that returns whether the word can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down.

CodingProblem12:
On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces.

CodingProblem13:
A number is considered perfect if its digits sum up to exactly 10. Given a positive integer n, return the n-th perfect number.

CodingProblem14:
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse it in-place.

CodingProblem15:
Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. That is, a 2D array where the value at the i-th row and j-th column is (i + 1) * (j + 1) (if 0-indexed) or i * j (if 1-indexed). Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.

CodingProblem16:
You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each row itself is ordered lexicographically.

CodingProblem17:
Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.

CodingProblem18:
Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

CodingProblem19:
Given the root of a binary tree, return a deepest node. 

CodingProblem20:
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

CodingProblem21:
You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions. You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the points. Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.

CodingProblem22:
Given an even number (greater than 2), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to the given number. If there are more than one solution possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.

CodingProblem23:
Given a list of integers and a number K, return which contiguous elements of the list sum to K.

CodingProblem24:
Given an integer list where each number represents the number of hops you can make, determine whether you can reach to the last index starting at index 0.

CodingProblem25:
Given a sorted list of integers, square the elements and give the output in sorted order.

CodingProblem26:
Given a string of words delimited by spaces, reverse the words in string. For example, given "hello world here", return "here world hello".

CodingProblem27:
Given a set of closed intervals, find the smallest set of numbers that covers all the intervals. If there are multiple smallest sets, return any of them.

CodingProblem28:
Given a binary tree, return all paths from the root to leaves.

CodingProblem29:
Given a string which we can delete at most k, return whether you can make a palindrome.

CodingProblem30:
You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell represents number of coins in that cell. Assuming we start at matrix[0][0], and can only move right or down, find the maximum number of coins you can collect by the bottom right corner.

CodingProblem31:
Given a string, return whether it represents a number.

CodingProblem32:
You have n fair coins and you flip them all at the same time. Any that come up tails you set aside. The ones that come up heads you flip again. How many rounds do you expect to play before only one coin remains?

CodingProblem33:
Given the root of a binary search tree, and a target K, return two nodes in the tree whose sum equals K.

CodingProblem34:
Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] rotated by two becomes [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]. Try solving this without creating a copy of the list. How many swap or move operations do you need?

CodingProblem35:
Let's represent an integer in a linked list format by having each node represent a digit in the number. The nodes make up the number in reversed order.

CodingProblem36:
Write a function that prints out all the steps necessary to complete the Tower of Hanoi. 

CodingProblem37:
Given a real number n, find the square root of n. For example, given n = 9, return 3.

CodingProblem38:
Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order and an integer k, return the maximum profit you can make from k buys and sells. You must buy the stock before you can sell it, and you must sell the stock before you can buy it again.

CodingProblem39:
Create a function that creates a pattern as a 2D array for a given number.

CodingProblem40:
Design and implement a HitCounter class that keeps track of requests (or hits). It should support the following operations:
record(timestamp): records a hit that happened at timestamp
total(): returns the total number of hits recorded
range(lower, upper): returns the number of hits that occurred between timestamps lower and upper (inclusive)

CodingProblem41:
Given a binary tree, find a minimum path sum from root to a leaf.

CodingProblem42:
Given an N by M matrix consisting only of 1's and 0's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

CodingProblem43:
Find the minimum number of coins required to make n cents.

CodingProblem44:
Given an iterator with methods next() and hasNext(), create a wrapper iterator, PeekableInterface, which also implements peek(). peek shows the next element that would be returned on next().

CodingProblem45:
Given an array of numbers and an index i, return the index of the nearest larger number of the number at index i, where distance is measured in array indices.

CodingProblem46:
Given the head of a singly linked list, swap every two nodes and return its head.
