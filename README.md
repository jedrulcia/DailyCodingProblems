#DailyCodingProblems (C#)
Repository with daily coding problems, to exercise on programming skills

CodingProblem1:
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

CodingProblem2:
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

CodingProblem3:
Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

CodingProblem4:
Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

CodingProblem5:
There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

CodingProblem6:
Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.

CodingProblem7:
Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except for one integer, which only occurs once, find and return the non-duplicated integer.

CodingProblem8: 
Given an array of strictly the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', segregate the values of the array so that all the Rs come first, the Gs come second, and the Bs come last. You can only swap elements of the array.

CodingProblem9:
Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.

CodingProblem10:
Given an unordered list of flights taken by someone, each represented as (origin, destination) pairs, and a starting airport, compute the person's itinerary. If no such itinerary exists, return null. If there are multiple possible itineraries, return the lexicographically smallest one. All flights must be used in the itinerary.

CodingProblem11:
Given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word, write a function that returns whether the word can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down.

CodingProblem12:
On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces.

CodingProblem13:
A number is considered perfect if its digits sum up to exactly 10. Given a positive integer n, return the n-th perfect number.

CodingProblem14:
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse it in-place.

CodingProblem15:
Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. That is, a 2D array where the value at the i-th row and j-th column is (i + 1) * (j + 1) (if 0-indexed) or i * j (if 1-indexed). Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.

CodingProblem16:
You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each row itself is ordered lexicographically.

CodingProblem17:
Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.

CodingProblem18:
Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

CodingProblem19:
Given the root of a binary tree, return a deepest node. 

CodingProblem20:
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

CodingProblem21:
You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions. You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the points. Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.

CodingProblem22:
Given an even number (greater than 2), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to the given number. If there are more than one solution possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.

CodingProblem23:
Given a list of integers and a number K, return which contiguous elements of the list sum to K.

CodingProblem24:
Given an integer list where each number represents the number of hops you can make, determine whether you can reach to the last index starting at index 0.

CodingProblem25:
Given a sorted list of integers, square the elements and give the output in sorted order.

CodingProblem26:
Given a string of words delimited by spaces, reverse the words in string. For example, given "hello world here", return "here world hello".

CodingProblem27:
Given a set of closed intervals, find the smallest set of numbers that covers all the intervals. If there are multiple smallest sets, return any of them.
